### Abstraction: DWA_07 Challenge 1

Following DWA6 challenge 1 in which I used **objects and functions as abstractions** to make the code for the _Book Connect_ library more maintainable, extendable and easier to change, I now rate all my  abstractions in terms of the best three and the worst three based on SOLID principles.

The questions I use to rate my abstractions are:
- Which were the three best abstractions, and why?
- Which were the three worst abstractions, and why?
- How can the three worst abstractions be improved via SOLID principles?

**Book Connect** is an online library and book search engine that allows users to browse through books in the library, click on them to get more information on the author, publishing date, as well as a book summary. The user is also able to search and filter books by genre and author. Additionally, the user can type in part of a book title, and have a list of all corresponding books shown to them.
